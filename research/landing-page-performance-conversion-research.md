# Landing Page Performance + Conversion Research

Last updated: 2026-02-10

## Executive Summary

The strongest evidence across Google guidance, UX benchmarks, accessibility standards, and experimentation research points to one consistent model:

`Relevance -> Clarity -> Trust -> Low Friction -> Speed -> Accessibility -> Continuous Testing`

A "premium" look helps, but it does not compensate for weak clarity, weak trust, poor speed, or high form friction.

## Key Findings

1. Speed directly affects business outcomes.
- Core Web Vitals remain the clearest quality baseline.
- Practical targets: LCP `<= 2.5s`, INP `<= 200ms`, CLS `<= 0.1` at the 75th percentile.
- Google case studies show measurable business lift after performance improvements.

2. Message match controls conversion quality.
- Google Ads documentation emphasizes landing-page relevance and usefulness.
- The ad promise, headline, offer, and CTA should align exactly.

3. Friction is a major conversion killer.
- Baymard research repeatedly shows forms and checkout flows are often more complex than needed.
- Every unnecessary input and every unclear step reduces completion rates.

4. Trust is structural.
- Credibility, policy clarity, recognizable brand identity, and visible reassurance close conversion gaps.
- Users infer safety from design coherence and transparency.

5. Accessibility increases total conversion surface.
- WCAG 2.2 essentials improve usability for all users, not only users with disabilities.
- Low contrast, tiny tap targets, and weak focus states create silent drop-off.

6. Team opinions are not enough.
- Controlled experiments remain the best method for causal learning.
- Without A/B discipline, redesign decisions are mostly assumptions.

## What You Should Learn

1. Performance operations for marketing pages.
- Core Web Vitals diagnostics and performance budgets.
- Image pipeline optimization.
- Script and rendering discipline.
- Real-user monitoring and regression tracking.

2. Conversion architecture.
- Intent mapping from acquisition source to page promise.
- Offer framing, CTA clarity, objection handling.
- Funnel instrumentation and event taxonomy.

3. Friction reduction.
- Progressive disclosure.
- Field minimization.
- Better defaults and shorter decision paths.

4. Trust and proof systems.
- Credibility hierarchy around CTA moments.
- Proof placement and transparency patterns.

5. Experimentation rigor.
- Hypothesis quality.
- Guardrail metrics.
- Test design and interpretation.

## Practical Audit Checklist

- Does the hero clearly state the value in one sentence?
- Does every section support a single conversion story?
- Is every CTA consistent with one primary action?
- Is unnecessary copy removed?
- Is each form field essential?
- Are trust signals placed near commitment points?
- Are performance targets hit on mobile?
- Is accessibility baseline met?
- Is an experiment roadmap defined before visual polish rounds?
